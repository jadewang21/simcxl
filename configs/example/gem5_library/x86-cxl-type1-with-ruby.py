This script shows an example of running a CXL type 1 accelerator(LSU) without memory
simulation using the gem5 library. It uses the Ruby memory system configured 
with the CXL_MESI_TWO_LEVEL protocol.
This simulation boots Ubuntu 18.04 using KVM CPU cores (switching from Atomic/KVM).
The simulation then switches to TIMING/O3 CPU core to run the benchmark.
